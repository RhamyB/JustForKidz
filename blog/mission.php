								<p>The following article was written by Hannah Belayachi, Content Creator for Public Relations, using data from the following sources: <a href="https://www.unicef.org/" target="_blank">UNICEF</a> and <a href="http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/" target="_blank">Action Against Hunger</a>.</p>

									<p>Kids are great! In fact, they make up about 27% of world population (about 1.9 billion children) as of 2016. With children being a little over a quarter of the world’s population, it’s important that they receive opportunities early on so that they can be placed on a path to succeed later on in their lives.</p>
									<p>Unfortunately, not all kids have access to such opportunities, and it’s because of factors that they can’t control.</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="../images/kids.png" alt="Kids" /></div>
									<p>In low- and in middle-income countries, one out of three children is undernourished. Of the 1.9 billion kids, 45% of all child deaths worldwide are from causes related to undernutrition, and at least 17 million children suffer from severe acute undernutrition. As of 2015, when it comes to their education and giving children the resources to enrich their minds, more than 100 million children worldwide do not attend school due to the poverty levels of their nation. Furthermore, children are even less likely to receive an education if they are orphan. According to UNICEF, 153 million children worldwide have lost either one parent (“single orphan”) or both parents (“double orphan”).</p>
									<p>As a child, everything that we receive is from an accident of birth; everyone has an equal chance of becoming a child of a billionaire or being a child of a villager in south western Africa. With the opportunities that we have received, we would like to bring those same opportunities we have had with education and nutrition to those who were not born with as much luck as us, as getting an education and being properly fed should not be factors that are determined by luck or privileges that come with living in a developed country.</p>
									<p><strong>They should be basic human rights.</strong></p>
