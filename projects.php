									<p>In efforts to expand our international impact and advance children's educational rights, Just For Kidz has selected Good Hope Orphanage as the beneficiary of our next project term. We are fundraising to build a secondary school (8th-12th grade) for 716 orphans and poor kids in the village so that they can escape the cycle of poverty and receive a college education. The orphanage will provide accomodations, shelter, and care for about 217 more orphans.</p>

										<h2>Walajapet, India<br />
										(2010-11)</h2>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Just For Kidz fundraised $1,200 dollars to change the asbestos roof of Dheenabandu Ashram, a small orphanage that houses, teaches, and protects about 200 orphans and poor children in the village. The leaky roof prevented the students from attending class, caused heat stroke, and put them at risk for mesothelioma. Volunteers and donations completely maintain the orphanage, as the government only grants 10 cents per child per day.</p>
